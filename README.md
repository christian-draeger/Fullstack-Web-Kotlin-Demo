This is a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Web, Server.

* `/composeApp` is for code that will be shared across your Compose Multiplatform applications.
  It contains several subfolders:
  - `commonMain` is for code thatâ€™s common for all targets.
  - Other folders are for Kotlin code that will be compiled for only the platform indicated in the folder name.

* `/server` is for the Spring-Boot server application.

* `/shared` is for the code that will be shared between all targets in the project.
  The most important subfolder is `commonMain`. If preferred, you can add code to the platform-specific folders here too.


You can open the web application by running the `:composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun` Gradle task.
